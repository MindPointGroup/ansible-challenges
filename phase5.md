#Phase 5: Troubleshooting
This phase will be different from the others. These modules are specifically designed to present you with problems you might come across, and requires you to really solve the challenge by troubleshooting. Therefore, giving you a bunch of background would tip the hat to where the problem is and what to do. So . . . no hints. Go run each of the plays outlined below, and then try to figure out what the issue is.
